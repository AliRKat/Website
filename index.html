                <p>I'm a Software and Game Developer with a strong background in Unity, SDK development, and
                    optimization. Passionate about game engines, low-level systems, and performance tuning.
                    Experienced in C++ and Unreal Engine, with a keen interest in developing for older hardware
                    like PS2 and PSP. Enthusiastic about open-source technologies, a dedicated Arch Linux user,
                    and always exploring ways to push the limits of software and hardware</p>

                    <h2>What I Do</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    I'm a game developer deeply specialized in <strong>Unity</strong>, where I’ve built everything from
                    physics-driven prototypes to complex systems with layered gameplay mechanics. I also have a solid
                    background in <strong>SDK development</strong> — writing, maintaining, and supporting SDKs across
                    multiple platforms with clean documentation and robust testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m someone who enjoys diving into new tech stacks and learning things quickly — whether it's
                    picking up a new language, framework, or tool. I write C#, C++, and JavaScript fluently, and enjoy
                    jumping into systems-level or full-stack development as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do all of this while living dangerously on <strong>Arch Linux</strong> — i3 window manager,
                    Neovim, terminal tooling, the whole shebang. It’s where I feel most productive and in control of my
                    environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the side, I mess with <strong>web development</strong> and <strong>bash scripting</strong> for
                    fun. I’m not just writing code — I like understanding how the whole machine works.

                    shipping cross-platform developer tools, I focus on building things that are fast, scalable, and fun
                    to work with.

                    <p>
                        As part of the SDK Engineering team at <strong>Countly</strong>, I contributed heavily to the
                        <a href="https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-unity" target="_blank">Unity</a>,

                        SDKs.

                    <p>
                        I handled core feature development, wrote automated test coverage, and managed full SDK releases
                        end to end — including changelogs, semantic versioning, and integration testing. I also revamped
                        and standardized the entire SDK documentation across platforms, making them more accessible,
                        up-to-date, and developer-friendly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond code, I supported developers directly via Zendesk and GitHub Issues, jumped into live
                        support calls when needed, and helped streamline the onboarding process for clients integrating
                        our SDKs into production apps.

                    I believe one of the best ways to understand someone is to see what they build, read, watch, and
                    enjoy. So if you're curious about how I think or what I care about, feel free to explore any of
                    these — they're all small pieces of the puzzle.
