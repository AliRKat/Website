                    <h2>What I Do</h2>
                </header>
                    <p>
                        I'm a game developer deeply specialized in <strong>Unity</strong>, where I’ve built everything from physics-driven prototypes to complex systems with layered gameplay mechanics. I also have a solid background in <strong>SDK development</strong> — writing, maintaining, and supporting SDKs across multiple platforms with clean documentation and robust testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m someone who enjoys diving into new tech stacks and learning things quickly — whether it's picking up a new language, framework, or tool. I write C#, C++, and JavaScript fluently, and enjoy jumping into systems-level or full-stack development as needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I do all of this while living dangerously on <strong>Arch Linux</strong> — i3 window manager, Neovim, terminal tooling, the whole shebang. It’s where I feel most productive and in control of my environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the side, I mess with <strong>web development</strong> and <strong>bash scripting</strong> for fun. I’m not just writing code — I like understanding how the whole machine works.

                        Here's a look at some of the games and tools I've built — from chart-topping mobile titles to battle-tested SDKs. Whether it's designing core systems in Unity, optimizing gameplay loops, or shipping cross-platform developer tools, I focus on building things that are fast, scalable, and fun to work with.

                <p>
                    A global hit with millions of downloads. I improved the core flow and polish, reworking the UI/UX and integrating mobile gaming trends to boost retention and playtime.

        <h3>SDK Development at Countly</h3>
        <p>
            As part of the SDK Engineering team at <strong>Countly</strong>, I contributed heavily to the
            <a href="https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-unity" target="_blank">Unity</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-nodejs" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, and
            <a href="https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-react-native" target="_blank">React Native</a> SDKs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I handled core feature development, wrote automated test coverage, and managed full SDK releases end to end — including changelogs, semantic versioning, and integration testing. I also revamped and standardized the entire SDK documentation across platforms, making them more accessible, up-to-date, and developer-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond code, I supported developers directly via Zendesk and GitHub Issues, jumped into live support calls when needed, and helped streamline the onboarding process for clients integrating our SDKs into production apps.

      I believe one of the best ways to understand someone is to see what they build, read, watch, and enjoy. So if you're curious about how I think or what I care about, feel free to explore any of these — they're all small pieces of the puzzle.
